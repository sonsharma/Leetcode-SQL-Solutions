SELECT 
    Request_at as Day, 
    ROUND(COUNT(IF(Status != 'completed', TRUE, NULL)) / COUNT(*), 2)as 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM Trips t
WHERE t.client_id not in (SELECT Users_id FROM Users where Banned = 'YES') 
	and t.driver_id not in (SELECT Users_id FROM Users where Banned = 'YES') 
	and Request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY Request_at

SELECT

FROM Trips t 
 LEFT JOIN Users u ON t.Client_id = u.Users_id or t.Driver_id = u.users_id and u.banned = 'yes' 
WHERE Request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY 1
